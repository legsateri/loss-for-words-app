# Loss For Words App

A community creative writing prop application. Users can find prompts that inspire them, comment with their own words, and submit new prompts for other people to respond to. 

## Motivation

Writers block is a very common thing, whether you simply write on occasion or professionally. I wanted to provide inspiration that is practical, fun to use, and engages users in a conversation.
